Experimental image mining using OpenCV
======================================

Attempting to build tools to mine interesting data from large collections of scanned images

Current
-------

* bin/locate-thumbnail: find the location of a thumbnail in the source image

Future Ideas
~~~~~~~~~~~~

* locate interesting non-text elements (images, figures, tables, etc.) on scanned book pages

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python 2.6+
* OpenCV
* numpy

Using Mac Homebrew this should install cleanly::

    brew install python numpy opencv
